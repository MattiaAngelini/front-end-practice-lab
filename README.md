# Frontend Portfolio - Vue3 and TypeScript

This project was developed to strengthen my frontend development skills using Vue3 and TypeScript. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to build a modular and reactive application, translating designs from Figma into Vue components while integrating concepts such as SPA, routing, and responsiveness.

The project includes:

Components like Header, Footer, Hero, CTA, Banner, and more.
Advanced type safety with TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.
Responsive design achieved with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
Logic management through loops, data structures, and modern patterns.
